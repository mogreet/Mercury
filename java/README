Mercury is a package that allows developers to use 
the MoMS (Mogreet Message System) API through Java.

The MoMS is a dynamic SMS, MMS and email messaging 
system which supports many different clients, 
many different campaigns, many different message flows, 
many different aggregators and many different carriers. 

This SDK provides programmatic control of the MoMS API through Java. 
Using this SDK, a client can trigger a send to a user over 
SMS, MMS, or email, check the status of a send, manage opt-in status and more.
