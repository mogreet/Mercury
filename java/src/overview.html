	This document is the <b>Mercury SDK</b> specification. It allows developers to use the MoMS (Mogreet Message System) API through Java. <br /><br />
	The	MoMS is a dynamic SMS, MMS and email messaging system which supports many different clients, many different campaigns, many different message flows, many different aggregators and many different carriers. This SDK provides programmatic control of the MoMS API through Java. Using this SDK, a client can trigger a send to a user over SMS, MMS, or email, check the status of a send, manage opt-in status and more.
